# Android MVVM Clean Architecture with Koin, Retrofit, and Coroutines

This project demonstrates a scalable Android architecture based on MVVM, leveraging Dependency Injection, asynchronous data handling, and modular design principles.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: Ensures separation of concerns and testability.
- **Koin**: Lightweight dependency injection for managing objects and services.
- **Retrofit**: Efficient HTTP client for networking and API interaction.
- **Coroutines**: Manages background tasks asynchronously with minimal boilerplate.
- **Navigation Components**: Simplifies fragment-based navigation using a navigation graph.

## 🔑 Core Components

### 🧠 Dependency Injection with Koin
Koin is used to inject ViewModels, repositories, and API services, reducing coupling and making unit testing easier.

### 🔄 Networking with Retrofit & GSON
Retrofit handles all API interactions, with GSON for JSON serialization and deserialization. Logging is managed via an HTTP interceptor for debugging.

### 🧵 Asynchronous Tasks with Coroutines
Coroutines power all background operations, such as network calls and data processing, in a lifecycle-aware and efficient way.

### 📦 ViewModel & Lifecycle Management
ViewModels handle business logic and retain data during configuration changes. Lifecycle-aware components prevent memory leaks.

### 🧭 Navigation
Navigation Components are used for fragment transitions, back stack management, and safe-arg passing between destinations.

## 🧩 Modularity

The project is designed with modularity in mind:
- Features and utilities can be separated into independent modules.
- Easily maintainable and scalable for growing codebases.

---

## ✅ Highlights

- Clean separation of UI and business logic.
- Testable and lightweight DI setup.
- Reactive data updates via ViewModel and LiveData/StateFlow.
- Secure and debuggable networking layer.
- Smooth navigation handling.

---

## 🛠 Best Practices Followed

- Single Source of Truth (data flows from ViewModel to UI).
- No memory leaks (lifecycle-aware coroutines and bindings).
- Consistent UI via centralized theme and reusable components.
- Efficient handling of screen rotations and configuration changes.
